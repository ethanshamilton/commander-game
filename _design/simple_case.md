# Simple Case
The simplest case of this game that we will use to implement it is an 8v8 firefight simulation. Here
is a list of all the things it should have: 

- The map will be 64x64 square grid
    - randomly generated cover on 3/8 of the map
- Each team will have 8 soldiers
    - player selects starting positions for their team
    - AI has randomly generated starting positions
- Each soldier will have the following: 
    - Basic rifle, 30 rounds, does 20 damage
    - 40 health
